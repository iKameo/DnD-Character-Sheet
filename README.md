## Bugs
As far as i know and tested, there are no ~~gamebreaking~~ bugs. But thanks to Apple and their ultimate wisdom, the site breaks
on Apple devices. No matter which browser you use. It is possible to use the site, it just wont be pretty. I dont know how to fix this
and i dont really care.

## Selfhosting
You´ll need a webserver which is capable of rendering `html` and `css` - so basically any webserver.
Drop the files and folders in this format into you `www` directory and your good to go
```js
css
  ⮡ onuava.woof
  ⮡ diablo.woff
  ⮡ stylesheet.css
assets
  ⮡ coins.svg
  ⮡ header.png
js
  ⮡ conversion.js
  ⮡ spelcasting.js
  ⮡ function.js
  ⮡ healthbar.js
  ⮡ calculation.js
index.html
```
